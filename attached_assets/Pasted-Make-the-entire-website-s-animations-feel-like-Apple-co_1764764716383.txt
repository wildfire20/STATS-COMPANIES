Make the entire website’s animations feel like Apple.com — smooth, elegant, premium, and minimal — using Framer Motion + Tailwind + Next.js.

I want all animations to reflect Apple’s signature style:

Subtle motion

Clean fade-ins

Soft parallax

Section-by-section reveal

Smooth transitions between pages

Micro-interactions on hover

High contrast, premium spacing

No cartoony/bouncy animations

Please implement the animation system across the website using the following rules:

✨ 1. GLOBAL ANIMATION STYLE (Apple-like)

Apply this animation style across the entire site:

Opacity fade-in

TranslateY(20px) upward motion

0.6–0.9s duration

0.1–0.2s delay

No bounce, no spring, no excessive easing

Use easing: "easeOut" or "easeInOut"

Example global animation:

const fadeInUp = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
  show: { opacity: 1, y: 0, transition: { duration: 0.8, ease: "easeOut" } }
};


Use this animation on:

Hero section

Headings

Service cards

Product listings

Portfolio items

Blog posts

Footer sections

🖼 2. HERO SECTION ANIMATIONS (Apple-Level Quality)

Implement:

A. Text fade + slight slide

Title fades in

Subtitle slides up softly

Buttons appear with delay

B. Background image slow zoom-in

Add this effect:

Image zooms from 100% → 105% over 6–10 seconds

Very smooth, subtle

No jitter

C. Staggered child animations

Each element in hero appears one after another, like Apple product pages.

🪄 3. SCROLL-BASED ANIMATIONS (Parallax + Reveal)

Add Apple-style scrolling effects:

A. Parallax

Images scroll slower than text

Background moves subtly

Sections feel 3D

B. Reveal on scroll

Each section animates when entering the viewport:

Fade in

Slide up 20px

0.8s duration

Use Intersection Observer or Framer Motion whileInView.

🎥 4. PRODUCT + SERVICE CARD ANIMATIONS

When the user hovers:

Slight scale (1.02–1.05)

Soft shadow

Image zoom

Description text fade upwards

No bounce

When the card appears on page load:

Fade in

Slide up softly

🌄 5. PORTFOLIO / GALLERY ANIMATIONS

Just like Apple’s product galleries:

Image fade-in from opacity 0 → 1

Slight float effect on hover

Parallax scrolling inside gallery sections

Smooth modal popup animations

🔄 6. PAGE TRANSITIONS (Apple-like smoothness)

Add main layout animation:

Fade page out

Fade next page in

Keep navigation fixed

0.4–0.6 seconds

Very smooth transitions

Use Framer Motion <AnimatePresence>.

🎯 7. MICRO-INTERACTIONS (Minimal + Clean)

Add subtle movements:

Buttons:

Soft hover glow

Slight movement upward

Quick ripple effect

Icons:

Light rotation (2–5 degrees)

Fade in on scroll

Images:

Hover zoom (2–4%)

Parallax on scroll

Inputs:

Border glow on focus

Placeholder fade

🖥 8. Implement the animation system across these pages:

Home

About

Services

Shop

Product page

Portfolio

Blog

Blog post page

Contact

Customer dashboard

Admin dashboard

Animations must remain minimal and elegant.

📦 9. Create reusable animation components

Build reusable motion components in:

/components/animations/


Examples:

FadeIn

FadeInUp

SlideInLeft

SlideInRight

ParallaxImage

RevealSection

PageTransitionWrapper

These can be imported anywhere.

🧨 FINAL INSTRUCTION TO REPLIT

Please:

Generate the full animation system

Integrate Framer Motion into all sections

Apply Apple.com-level premium transitions

Add parallax, fade-ins, micro-interactions, and smooth page transitions

Optimize for performance (no heavy Lottie files)

Ensure animations are mobile-friendly

Make the entire site feel luxurious like Apple.com
